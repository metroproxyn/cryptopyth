# cryptopyth
I want to write a Python library to implement cryptographic algorithms.

For now, it contains:
* Reverse cipher
* Caesar cipher
* XOR cipher (in progress)

(TBS)

I want to write documentation with information about what each ciphers does and how it works.

I also plan to cover code with automated tests using the unittest or pytest libraries.
